## Branch Structure


| Branch               | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `master`             | Production-ready code. Always stable. Protected.                        |
| `staging`            | QA/testing branch for integrating all features before a release.        |
| `release/vX.Y.Z`     | Pre-production branch used for final testing before going live.         |
| `@username/feature-*`| Feature branches under a personal namespace.                            |
| `@username/fix-*`    | Bugfix branches under a personal namespace.                             |

### Example of Branch Naming Conventions

## Development Workflow

### 1. Clone the Repository (if you haven't)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thebuildershq/troott-client-web.git
cd troott-client-web
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

Open a feature branch from the staging branch.

```bash
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging
git checkout -b @username/feature-your-task-name
```

Tip: Use a descriptive and concise name for your branch. Follow this format:

`@username/feature-short-description`

Example: `@damolaoladipo/feature-user-invitation-endpoint`

### 3. Develop Your Feature

Make your changes, test locally, and commit often using clear commit messages.

### 4. Sync with Latest Changes on staging

Before pushing or merging your feature, make sure your branch is up to date.

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/staging
```

### 5. Push to Remote

```bash
git push origin @username/feature-your-task
```

### 6. Merge into staging (after PR approval)

```bash
git checkout staging
git merge @username/feature-your-task-name
git push origin staging
```

 Your pull request (PR) should target `staging` — not master.  
Reference the issue number in the PR description (e.g., Closes #502).

### 7. Create a Release Branch

When ready for deployment, create a release branch from staging.

```bash
git checkout -b release/v1.0.2
git push origin release/v1.0.2
```

Final QA and bug-fixing happen on this release/* branch before production deployment.

### 8. Merge Release into master and staging

After final QA on the release branch, merge it into both master and staging to complete the release.

```bash
# Merge into master
git checkout master
git merge release/v1.0.2
git push origin master

# Merge back into staging to ensure it stays updated
git checkout staging
git merge release/v1.0.2
git push origin staging
```

### Creating an Issue

If you discover a bug or have a suggestion, raise an issue via the GitHub Issues tab (if you have permission), or notify your team lead for triage and assignment.
